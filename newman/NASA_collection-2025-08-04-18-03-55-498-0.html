Discovered in 2022 by amateur astronomers, the faint arcs -- dubbed SDSO 1 -- span nearly the same angular size as M31 itself.  At first, their origin was a mystery: are they actually near the Andromeda Galaxy, or alternatively near to our Sun?  Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.  Shown in blue are extremely faint oxygen emission from the shock waves, while the surrounding red is a hydrogen-emitting trail that indicates the GPN&#x27;s age.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_5415.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Arcs Toward Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_960.jpg&quot;}

By any name NGC 2359 is a bubble-like nebula some 30 light-years across, blown by energetic winds from an extremely hot star seen near the center and classified as a Wolf-Rayet star. Wolf-Rayet stars are rare massive blue giants which develop stellar winds with speeds of millions of kilometers per hour. Interactions with a nearby large molecular cloud are thought to have contributed to this nebula&#x27;s more complex shape and curved bow-shock structures. NGC 2359 is about 15,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Canis Major.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/thor_cfht_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Thor&#x27;s Helmet from CFHT&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/thor_cfht.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMartin Pugh;\n Rollover Annotation:  Judy Schmidt\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2016-05-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;That&#x27;s not lightning, and it did not strike between those mountains. The diagonal band is actually the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, while the twin peaks are actually called the Spanish Peaks -- but located in Colorado, USA. Although each Spanish peak is composed of a slightly different type of rock, both are approximately 25 million years old.  This serene yet spirited image composite was meticulously created by merging a series of images all taken from the same location on one night and early last month. In the first series of exposures, the background sky was built up, with great detail being revealed in the Milky Way dust lanes as well as the large colorful region surrounding the star Rho Ophiuchus just right of center.  One sky image, though, was taken using a fogging filter so that brighter stars would appear more spread out and so more prominent. As a bonus, the planets Mars and Saturn are placed right above peaks and make an orange triangle with the bright star Antares. Later that night, after the moonrise, the Moon itself naturally illuminated the snow covered mountain tops.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1605/SpanishPeaksMW_Pugh_1676.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Over the Spanish Peaks&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1605/SpanishPeaksMW_Pugh_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Maxime Oudoux&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-06-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;With this creative astro-collaboration you can follow the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy as it bridges northern and southern hemisphere skies. To construct the expansive composite nightscape, skies over Observatorio El Sauce in Chile (top) were imaged on the same date but 6 hours later than the skies over the Saint-Veran observatory in the French Alps. The 6 hour time-lag allowed Earth&#x27;s rotation to align the Milky Way above domes at the two sites. All exposures were made with similar cameras and lenses mounted on simple tripods. A faint greenish airglow is visible in the dark Chilean sky that also features the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds near the observatory dome. In the French Alps light pollution is apparent, but the distant Andromeda Galaxy can still be spotted near the horizon in the northern night. On planet Earth the two observatories are separated by about 10,000 kilometers.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2206/Oudoux-and-Jeff-Graphy-with10000km.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A 10,000 Kilometer Galactic Bridge&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2206/Oudoux-and-Jeff-Graphy-with10000km_c.jpg&quot;}]

Discovered in 2022 by amateur astronomers, the faint arcs -- dubbed SDSO 1 -- span nearly the same angular size as M31 itself.  At first, their origin was a mystery: are they actually near the Andromeda Galaxy, or alternatively near to our Sun?  Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.  Shown in blue are extremely faint oxygen emission from the shock waves, while the surrounding red is a hydrogen-emitting trail that indicates the GPN&#x27;s age.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_5415.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Arcs Toward Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_960.jpg&quot;}

Measured to be only 11 million light-years distant it is nearby though. Tilted nearly edge-on as seen from our perspective, it dominates this telescopic field of view toward the southern constellation Cetus. The pronounced void on one side of the galaxy&#x27;s disk recalls for some its popular name, the Needle&#x27;s Eye galaxy. Many background galaxies are visible in this sharp galaxy portrait, including the remarkable string of four galaxies just below and left of NGC 247 known as Burbidge&#x27;s Chain. Burbidge&#x27;s Chain galaxies are about 300 million light-years distant. NGC 247 itself is part of the Sculptor Group of galaxies along with shiny spiral NGC 253.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/NGC247-Hag-Ben2048.JPG&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 247 and Friends&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/NGC247-Hag-Ben1024.JPG&quot;}

Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water \u2014 but why? If the water\u2019s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.

Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.  The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.  For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.  The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.  Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.  In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy M82.  This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat, as they have been for the past billion years.   The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82&#x27;s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81&#x27;s spiral arms.

In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab&#x27;s dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023. This cosmic crustacean lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA\u2019s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.

The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn&#x27;t represent a beginning, though. Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto&#x27;s tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet).

Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth&#x27;s shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS&#x27;s silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.

Constructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning scene spans about half a light-year across Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400 parsecs away in the stellar nurseries of the Orion B molecular cloud complex. Hidden from direct view, HH 24&#x27;s central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system&#x27;s rotation axis. Cutting through the region&#x27;s interstellar matter, the narrow, energetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts along their path.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-fullHH24.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Herbig-Haro 24&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/hs-2015-42-a-largeHH241024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Franz Hofmann&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the attention, flaunting young, bright, blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along graceful, symmetric spiral arms. But small galaxies form stars too, like irregular dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Its young star clusters and star forming regions are gathered into a gumdrop-shaped region a mere 5,000 light-years across. Seen toward the navigational constellation Sextans, the small galaxy lies some 4.5 million light-years distant. That puts it near the outskirts of the local group of galaxies, that includes the large, massive spirals Andromeda and our own Milky Way. Brighter Milky Way foreground stars appear spiky and yellowish in this colorful telescopic view of Sextans A.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Irregular Dwarf Galaxy Sextans A&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-30&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This composite of images spaced a weather-permitting 5 to 9 days apart, from 2024 September 19 (top right) through 2025 May 18 (bottom left), faithfully traces ruddy-colored Mars as it makes a clockwise loop through the constellations Gemini and Cancer in planet Earth&#x27;s night sky. You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet&#x27;s 2024/25 retrograde motion. Of course Mars didn&#x27;t actually reverse the direction of its orbit. Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  In this case Mars&#x27; apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer. After wandering back to the west, under Gemini&#x27;s bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May. At its brightest near opposition on 2025 January 16, Mars was a mere 96 million kilometers away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mars in the Loop&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Marcella Giulia Pace&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-31&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On May 7, the Sun setting behind a church bell tower was captured in this filtered and manipulated digital skyscape from Ragusa, Sicily, planet Earth. In this version of the image the colors look bizarre. Still, an intriguing optical illusion known as an afterimage can help you experience the same scene with a more natural looking appearance. To try it, find the sunspots of active region AR4079 grouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk. Relax and stare at the dark sunspot group for about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or shift your gaze to a plain white surface. In a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear.

Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring&#x27;s blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.  Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekick over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_3079.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UGC 1810: Wildly Interacting Galaxy from Hubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAbdullah Alharbi\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways. To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA&#x27;s NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Cerro Pach\u00f3n, Chile. In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe&#x27;s large-scale structure.  Pictured, the distant central band of our Milky Way Galaxy appears to flow out from the newly operational observatory. Taken last month, the featured picture is a composite of 21 images across the night sky, capturing airglow on the horizon and the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy on the lower left.

A navigational aid for sailors on the Adriatic Sea, the historic lighthouse was constructed in the early 19th century. But Polaris, an even older aid to navigation, shines in the sky above. Alpha star of the constellation Ursa Minor, Polaris is also known as the North Star. In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric star trails.

With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C, the central star of the planetary nebula is transforming into a white dwarf star, becoming exceptionally hot, and shining brightly in ultraviolet light. The central star is hidden from direct view by a torus of dust, but its energetic ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the nebula. In this sharp, telescopic view composed with narrowband image data, the ionized hydrogen and doubly ionized oxygen atoms are shown in their characteristic red and blue-green hues to reveal a stunning complex of knots and filaments within the nebula&#x27;s wing-like bipolar outflows. NGC 6302 lies about 4,000 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6302: The Butterfly Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On the Mars rover&#x27;s mission Sol 46 or Earth date April 6, 2021, Perseverance held out a robotic arm to take its first selfie on Mars. The WATSON camera at the end of the arm was designed to take close-ups of Martian rocks and surface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and smiling faces. In the end, teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time was required to program a complex series of exposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its surroundings. The resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosaic, one of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken. In this version of the selfie, the rover&#x27;s Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking toward WATSON and the end of the rover&#x27;s outstretched arm. About 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter. Perseverance has now spent over 1,500 sols exploring the surface of the Red Planet.

Nearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo Minor. This multi-color Hubble Space Telescope close-up of NGC 3344 includes remarkable details from near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. The frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the spiral&#x27;s central regions. From the core outward, the galaxy&#x27;s colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. Of course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance are in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.

Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) \u2014 a nod to the ancient Greek expression \&quot;caught between Scylla and Charybdis\&quot; from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Do oceans under the ice of Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus contain life?  A reason to think so involves  long features -- some dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon&#x27;s icy interior into space. These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon&#x27;s South Pole and create  Saturn&#x27;s mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown in true color from a close flyby.  The deep crevasses are partly shadowed.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus&#x27; surface could contain life.

It&#x27;s likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (\&quot;the scorcher\&quot; in Latin), Vega (\&quot;falling\&quot; in Arabic), and Antares (\&quot;rival to Mars\&quot; in Greek).

When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse. Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular \&quot;ring of fire\&quot; eclipse depending on the observer&#x27;s position. Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia. This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the eclipsed Sun&#x27;s magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space. The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.

Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and American astronomer Vera Rubin&#x27;s pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies.

For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA&#x27;s robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that&#x27;s not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette&#x27;s field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula&#x27;s center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon. This flowery field can be found toward the constellation of the Unicorn  (Monoceros).

It&#x27;s the International Space Station. Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon in 2019. The featured image was taken from Palo Alto, California, USA with an exposure time of only 1/667 of a second. In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.  A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.

Relatively bright in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It&#x27;s hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. The deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Luca Vanzella&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon in this stack of panoramic composite images. In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again. It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise. Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon. But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises. That&#x27;s because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill. Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Major Lunar Standstill 2024-2025&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD_1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth&#x27;s sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma. On the left, Earth&#x27;s figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012. But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet&#x27;s orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds. Take Mars for example. The Red Planet&#x27;s axial tilt is similar to Earth&#x27;s, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth&#x27;s orbit. As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop. The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008. Of course, each world&#x27;s solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves. The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025. Our fair planet&#x27;s 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Two Worlds, Two Analemmas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How were these unusual Martian spherules created?  Thousands of unusual gray spherules made of iron and rock and dubbed blueberries were found embedded in and surrounding rocks near the landing site of the robot Opportunity rover on Mars in 2004.  To help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a surface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was rich in the Martian orbs.  The Berry Bowl is pictured here, imaged during rover&#x27;s 48th Martian day.  The average size of a Martian blueberry rock is only about 4 millimeters across.  By analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the left of the densest patch of spherules, Opportunity obtained data showing that the underlying rock has a much different composition than the hematite rich blueberries.  This information contributes to the growing consensus that these small, strange, gray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of dirty water.

Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA&#x27;s Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.  Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.  W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

Sort of.  Image data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory, and smaller telescopes on planet Earth are combined in this detailed portrait of face-on spiral galaxy Messier 61 (M61) and its bright center. A mere 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, M61 is also known as NGC 4303.  It&#x27;s considered to be an example of a barred spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way.  Like other spiral galaxies, M61 also features sweeping spiral arms, cosmic dust lanes, pinkish star forming regions, and young blue star clusters.  Its core houses an active supermassive black hole surrounded by a bright nuclear spiral -- infalling star-forming gas that itself looks like a separate spiral galaxy.

A First Look image captured at the new NSF\u2013DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the bright nebulae and star clusters featured include famous stops on telescopic tours of the cosmos: Messier 8 and Messier 20. An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars. Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon&#x27;s turbulent depths. Messier 20&#x27;s popular moniker is the Trifid. Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula&#x27;s glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color. But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The Rubin Observatory visited the Trifid-Lagoon field to acquire all the image data during parts of four nights (May 1-4).

This broadband portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 3.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, in the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). The bright head of the Seagull Nebula is cataloged as IC 2177, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with embedded massive star HD 53367. The larger emission region, encompassing objects with other catalog designations, is Likely part of an extensive shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions. The notable bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris. Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of interstellar gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula&#x27;s estimated 3,800 light-year distance.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Seagull Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Robert Eder&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Big beautiful barred spiral galaxy Messier 109 is the 109th entry in Charles Messier&#x27;s famous catalog of bright Nebulae and Star Clusters. You can find it just below the Big Dipper&#x27;s bowl in the northern constellation Ursa Major. In fact, bright dipper star Phecda, Gamma Ursa Majoris, produces the glare at the upper right corner of this telescopic frame. M109&#x27;s prominent central bar gives the galaxy the appearance of the Greek letter \&quot;theta\&quot;, \u03b8, a common mathematical symbol representing an angle. M109 spans a very small angle in planet Earth&#x27;s sky though, about 7 arcminutes or 0.12 degrees. But that small angle corresponds to an enormous 120,000 light-year diameter at the galaxy&#x27;s estimated 60 million light-year distance. The brightest member of the now recognized Ursa Major galaxy cluster, M109 (aka NGC 3992) is joined by spiky foreground stars. Three small, fuzzy bluish galaxies also on the scene, identified (top to bottom) as UGC 6969, UGC 6940 and UGC 6923, are possibly satellite galaxies of the larger barred spiral galaxy Messier 109.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 109&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-28&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its familiar nearside to denizens of planet Earth. From lunar orbit, the Moon&#x27;s farside can become familiar, though. In fact this sharp picture, a mosaic from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s wide angle camera, is centered on the lunar farside. Part of a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011, the highest resolution version shows features at a scale of 100 meters per pixel. Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro1600.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lunar Farside&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Are these trees growing on Mars? No.  Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost. The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars. At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.  When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows. Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer. Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy&#x27;s bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years. The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia.

No. Capturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: being in the right place at the right time. In the featured image taken in June 2024 from Otago, New Zealand, the bright central core of our Milky Way Galaxy, home to the many of our Galaxy&#x27;s 400 billion stars, can be seen between two picturesque rocks spires.  For observers in Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere, the core is only visible throughout the summer. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Milky Way become visible at different angles at different times of the night. As Earth rotates, the orientation of the Milky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes standing vertically as seen in the featured image, and other times stretching parallel to the horizon, making it harder to see. In early June, observers can watch it emerge low on the horizon after sunset and gradually arc upward to reveal its full grandeur.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_1874.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Through Otago Spires&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMatipon Tangmatitham \n(NARIT)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you know where to look, you can see a thermonuclear explosion from a white dwarf star.

Similarly, Nova Velorum 2025, toward the southern constellation of the Ship Sails (Vela), was discovered on June 25 and peaked a few days later.  A nova somewhere in our Galaxy becomes briefly visible to the unaided eye only every year or two, so it is quite unusual to have two novas visible simultaneously.

Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#x27;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, one investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ou4: The Giant Squid Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Why is there a spiral around the North Pole of Mars?

The comet&#x27;s trajectory is shown in white on the featured map, where the orbits of Jupiter, Mars, and Earth are shown in gold, red, and blue. Currently Comet 3I/ATLAS is about the distance of Jupiter from the Sun -- but closing, with its closest approach to our Sun expected to be within the orbit of Mars in late October. Expected to pass near both Mars and Jupiter, 3I/ATLAS is not expected to pass close to the Earth.  The origin of Comet 3I/ATLAS remains unknown.

But your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- the gas and dust surrounding it -- under dark skies. However, telescopes can catch even more. The bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, light up their surrounding dust, causing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures.

A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But, the red emission region roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes is what lends the Trifid its popular name. Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula&#x27;s center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region.

Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star featured here at the nebula&#x27;s center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star&#x27;s own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.

NGC 2685 is a confirmed polar ring galaxy - a rare type of galaxy with stars, gas and dust orbiting in rings perpendicular to the plane of a flat galactic disk. The bizarre configuration could be caused by the chance capture of material from another galaxy by a disk galaxy, with the captured debris strung out in a rotating ring. Still, observed properties of NGC 2685 suggest that the rotating helix structure is remarkably old and stable. In this sharp view of the peculiar system also known as Arp 336 or the Helix galaxy, the strange, perpendicular rings are easy to trace as they pass in front of the galactic disk, along with other disturbed outer structures.

Hebes Chasma is a depression just north of the enormous Valles Marineris canyon.  Since the depression is unconnected to other surface features, it is unclear where the internal material went. Inside Hebes Chasma is Hebes Mensa, a 5 kilometer high mesa that appears to have undergone an unusual partial collapse -- a collapse that might be providing clues. The featured image, taken by ESA&#x27;s robotic Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, shows great details of the chasm and the unusual horseshoe shaped indentation in the central mesa. Material from the mesa appears to have flowed onto the floor of the chasm, while a possible dark layer appears to have pooled like ink on a downslope landing.

Inside the nebula lies an open cluster of bright young stars designated NGC 2244. These stars formed about four million years ago from the nebular material and their stellar winds are clearing a hole in the nebula&#x27;s center, insulated by a layer of dust and hot gas. Ultraviolet light from the hot cluster stars causes the surrounding nebula to glow.

Yes, when the first explosion acts like a detonator for the second. This is a leading hypothesis for the cause of supernova remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5.  In this two-star system, gravity causes the larger and fluffier star to give up mass to a smaller and denser white dwarf companion. Eventually the white dwarf&#x27;s near-surface temperature goes so high that it explodes, creating a shock wave that goes both out and in -- and so triggers a full Type Ia supernova near the center. Recent images of the SNR 0509-67.5 system, like the featured image from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, show two shells with radii and compositions consistent with the double detonation hypothesis. This system, SNR 0509-67.5 is also famous for two standing mysteries: why its bright supernova wasn&#x27;t noted 400 years ago, and why no visible companion star remains.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_3000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A Double Detonation Supernova&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/DoubleSN_ESO_1080.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nJason Rice\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever seen a fireball?

Physically, a fireball is a small rock that originated from an asteroid or comet that typically leaves a fading smoke trail of gas and dust as it shoots through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Its final shadow transit will be on October 6, though Titan&#x27;s pale disk will continue to cross in front of Saturn as seen from telescopes on planet Earth every 16 days through January 25, 2026.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/SaturnJuly18_2025TitanShadowTransit1200.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Titan Shadow Transit&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/SaturnJuly18_2025TitanShadowTransit1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Petr Hor\u00e1lek&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-25&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Meteors from the Kappa Cygnid meteor shower are captured in this time-lapse composite skyscape. The minor meteor shower, with a radiant not far from its eponymous star Kappa Cygni, peaks in mid-August, almost at the same time as the much better-known and better-observed Perseid meteor shower. But, seen to have a peak rate of only about 3 meteors per hour, Kappa Cygnids are vastly outnumbered by the more popular, prolific Perseid shower&#x27;s meteors that emanate from the heroic constellation Perseus. To capture dozens of Kappa Cygnids, this long term astro-imaging project compiled meteors in exposures selected from over 51 August nights during the years 2012 through 2024. Most of the exposures with identified Kappa Cygnid meteors were made in August 2021, a high point of the shower&#x27;s known 7-year activity cycle. All twelve years worth of Kappa Cygnids are registered against a base sea and night skyscape of the Milky Way above Elafonisi Beach, Crete, Greece, also recorded in August of 2021.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/KCG2021_08_11_Pano_Elafonisi_met_fin-CCMZ_1500px.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Twelve Years of Kappa Cygnids&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/KCG2021_08_11_Pano_Elafonisi_met_fin-CCMZ_1024px.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Leo Shatz&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-26&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Globular star cluster Omega Centauri packs about 10 million stars much older than the Sun into a volume some 150 light-years in diameter. Also known as NGC 5139, at a distance of 15,000 light-years it&#x27;s the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a yellowish hue, Omega Centauri&#x27;s red giant stars are easy to pick out in this sharp telescopic view.  A two-decade-long exploration of the dense star cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed evidence for a massive black hole near the center of Omega Centauri.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/oc_ls_2025.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Globular Cluster Omega Centauri&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/oc_ls_2025_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Have you ever watched a lightning storm in awe?  You&#x27;re not alone. Details of what causes lightning are still being researched, but it is known that inside some clouds, internal updrafts cause collisions between ice and snow that slowly separate charges between cloud tops and bottoms. The rapid electrical discharges that are lightning soon result.  Lightning usually takes a jagged course, rapidly heating a thin column of air to about three times the surface temperature of the Sun.  The resulting shock wave starts supersonically and decays into the loud sound known as thunder.  On average, around the world, about 6,000 lightning bolts occur between clouds and the Earth every minute. Pictured in July 2019 in a two-image composite, lightning stems from communication antennas near the top of Volc\u00e1n de Agua (Volcano of Water) in Guatemala.

In 2022, to develop Earth-saving technology, NASA deliberately crashed the DART spacecraft into the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos. The hope was that this collision would alter the trajectory of Dimorphos around its parent asteroid Didymos and so demonstrate that similar collisions could, in theory, save the Earth from being hit by (other) hazardous asteroids.  But analyses of new results show that the effects of the collision are different than expected -- and we are trying to understand why.  Featured here is the time lapse video taken by the ejected LICIACube camera LUKE showing about 250 seconds of the expanding debris field of Dimorphos after the collision, with un-impacted Didymos passing in the foreground.  In 2026, Europe&#x27;s Hera mission will reach the asteroids and release three spacecraft to better study the matter.&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;other&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Collision at Asteroid Dimorphos&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nGeorge Chatzifrantzis\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Is the Helix Nebula looking at you? No, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye. The Helix Nebula is so named because it also appears that you are looking down the axis of a helix. In actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry, including radial filaments and extended outer loops.  The Helix Nebula (aka NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The featured picture, taken in red, green, and blue but highlighted by light emitted primarily by hydrogen was created from 12 hours of exposure through a personal telescope located in Greece.  A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots the origin of which are  still being researched.

Hot solar plasma jumps off the Sun&#x27;s surface into prominences, with the most common type of prominence being a simple loop.  The loop shape originates from the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field, which is traced by spiraling electrons and protons.  Many loops into the Sun&#x27;s lower corona are large enough to envelop the Earth and are stable enough to last days.  They commonly occur near active regions that also include dark sunspots.  The featured panel shows four loops, each of which was captured near the Sun&#x27;s edge during 2024 and 2025. The images were taken by a personal telescope in Mantova, Italy and in a very specific color of light emitted primarily by hydrogen. Some solar prominences suddenly break open and eject particles into the Solar System, setting up a space weather sequence that can affect the skies and wires of Earth.

Light from that supernova was first detected by telescopes on planet Earth on July 14th though, and the extragalactic transient is now known to astronomers as supernova 2025rbs. Presently the brightest supernova in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, 2025rbs is a Type Ia supernova, likely caused by the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf star that accreted material from a companion in a binary star system.  Type Ia supernovae are used as standard candles to establish the distance scale of the universe. The host galaxy of 2025rbs is NGC 7331. Itself a bright spiral galaxy in the northern constellation Pegasus, NGC 7331 is often touted as an analog to our own Milky Way.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/2025rbsAnnotated1024.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Supernova 2025rbs in NGC 7331&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/2025rbsAnnotated1024.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Peter Bresseler&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-01&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;A small, dark, nebula looks isolated near the center of this telescopic close-up. The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble&#x27;s iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16&#x27;s diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Small Dark Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/BokGlobule_1_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Daniel Korona&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-02&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Taken on July 29 and July 30, a registered and stacked series of exposures creates this dreamlike view of a northern summer night. Multiple firefly flashes streak across the foreground as the luminous Milky Way arcs above the horizon in the Sierra de \u00d3rganos national park of central Mexico. The collection of bright streaks aligned across the sky toward the upper left in the timelapse image are Delta Aquariid meteors. Currently active, the annual Delta Aquariid meteor shower shares August nights though, overlapping with the better-known Perseid meteor shower. This year that makes post-midnight, mostly moonless skies in early August very popular with late night skygazers. How can you tell a Delta Aquariid from a Perseid meteor?  The streaks of Perseid meteors can be traced back to an apparent radiant in the constellation Perseus. Delta Aquariids appear to emerge from the more southerly constellation Aquarius, beyond the top left of this frame. Of course, the bioluminescent flashes of fireflies are common too on these northern summer nights. But how can you tell a firefly from a meteor? Just try to catch one.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/DeltaAqrFireflies.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fireflies, Meteors, and Milky Way&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/DeltaAqrFireflies1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nAndre van der Hoeven\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;In about a week the Perseid Meteor Shower will reach its maximum.  Grains of icy rock will streak across the sky as they evaporate during entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.  These grains were shed from Comet Swift-Tuttle.  The Perseids result from the annual crossing of the Earth through Comet Swift-Tuttle&#x27;s orbit, and are typically the most active meteor shower of the year.  Although it is hard to predict the level of activity in any meteor shower, in a clear dark sky an observer might see a meteor a minute.  This year&#x27;s Perseids peak just a few days after  full moon, and so some faint meteors will be lost to the lunar skyglow.  Meteor showers in general are best seen from a relaxing position, away from lights.  Featured here is a meteor caught exploding during the 2015 Perseids above Austria next to the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorBoom_vanderHoeven_750.gif&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way and Exploding Meteor&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/MeteorBoom_vanderHoeven_750.gif&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nOgle et \nal.\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-08-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What are these gigantic blue arcs near the Andromeda Galaxy (M31)?  Discovered in 2022 by amateur astronomers, the faint arcs -- dubbed SDSO 1 -- span nearly the same angular size as M31 itself.  At first, their origin was a mystery: are they actually near the Andromeda Galaxy, or alternatively near to our Sun?  Now, over 550 hours of combined exposure and a collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers has revealed strong evidence for their true nature: SDSO 1 is not intergalactic, but a new class of planetary nebula within our galaxy.  Dubbed a Ghost Planetary Nebula (GPN), SDSO 1 is the first recognized member of a new subclass of faded planetary nebulas, along with seven others also recently identified.  Shown in blue are extremely faint oxygen emission from the shock waves, while the surrounding red is a hydrogen-emitting trail that indicates the GPN&#x27;s age.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_5415.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue Arcs Toward Andromeda&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2508/M31Oxy_Collab_960.jpg&quot;}]

Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water \u2014 but why? If the water\u2019s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.

Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.  The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.  For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.  The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.  Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.  In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy M82.  This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat, as they have been for the past billion years.   The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82&#x27;s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81&#x27;s spiral arms.  But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  This big battle is seen from Earth through the faint glow of an Integrated Flux Nebula, a little studied complex of diffuse gas and dust clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy. In a few billion years, only one galaxy will remain.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_3780.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxy Wars: M81 versus M82&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Cataloged as M1, the Crab Nebula is the first on Charles Messier&#x27;s famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab&#x27;s dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023. This cosmic crustacean lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA\u2019s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.

Barnacle Bill is the rock just left of the house cat-sized, solar-paneled Sojourner. Yogi is the big friendly-looking boulder at top right. The \&quot;couch\&quot; is the angular rock shape visible near center on the horizon. Look at the image with red/blue glasses (or just hold a piece of clear red plastic over your left eye and blue or green over your right) to get the dramatic 3D perspective. The stereo view was recorded by the remarkable Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) camera. The IMP had two optical paths for stereo imaging and ranging and was equipped with an array of color filters for spectral analysis.  Operating as the first astronomical observatory on Mars, the IMP also recorded images of the Sun and Deimos, the smallest of Mars&#x27; two tiny moons.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/mars10_st_path_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Yogi and Friends in 3D&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/mars10_st_path_big.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Donald Mitchell&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you could stand on Venus -- what would you see?

The desolate landscape it saw included flat rocks, vast empty terrain, and a featureless sky above Phoebe Regio near Venus&#x27; equator. On the lower left is the spacecraft&#x27;s penetrometer used to make scientific measurements, while the light piece on the right is part of an ejected lens-cap.  Enduring temperatures near 450 degrees Celsius and pressures 75 times that on Earth, the hardened Venera spacecraft lasted only about an hour. Although data from Venera 14 was beamed across the inner Solar System over 40 years ago, digital processing and merging of Venera&#x27;s unusual images continues even today.  Recent analyses of infrared measurements taken by ESA&#x27;s orbiting Venus Express spacecraft indicate that active volcanoes may currently exist on Venus.

The resulting featured illustration shows that just like many other spiral galaxies, our Milky Way has a very thin central disk. Our Sun and all the stars we see at night are in this disk. Although hypothesized before, perhaps more surprising is that the disk appears curved at the outer edges. The colors of our Galaxy&#x27;s warped central band derive mostly from dark dust, bright blue stars, and red emission nebulas.

The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn&#x27;t represent a beginning, though. Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. The sharp image shows stunning features of the galaxy&#x27;s face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself. Also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation Ursa Major, about 25 million light-years away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M101_hst6000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M101_hst1280.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This close-up from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern Acidalia Planitia.

But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the sci-fi novel, \&quot;The Martian,\&quot; by Andy Weir. The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site, corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame. For scale, Watney&#x27;s 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater.

In a clear sky from a dark location at the right time, a faint band of light becomes visible across the sky.  Soon after your eyes become dark adapted, you might spot the band for the first time.  It may then become obvious.  Then spectacular.  One reason for your growing astonishment might be the realization that this fuzzy swath, the Milky Way, contains billions of stars.  Visible in the featured image, high above in the night sky, the band of the Milky Way Galaxy arcs.  Also visible are the colorful clouds of Rho Ophiuchi on the right, and the red and circular Zeta Ophiuchi nebula near the top center. Taken in late February from Maunakea, Hawaii, USA, the foreground telescope is the University of Hawaii&#x27;s 2.2-Meter Telescope.

Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth&#x27;s shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS&#x27;s silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.  This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several Sun&#x27;s prominences around the edge.

Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy. This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy&#x27;s halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63&#x27;s star streams in the next few billion years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Curly Spiral Galaxy M63&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Massimo Di Fusco&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Most globular star clusters roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, but globular cluster NGC 6366 lies close to the galactic plane. About 12,000 light-years away toward the constellation Ophiuchus, the cluster&#x27;s starlight is dimmed and reddened by the Milky Way&#x27;s interstellar dust when viewed from planet Earth. As a result, the stars of NGC 6366 look almost golden in this telescopic scene, especially when seen next to relatively bright, bluish, and nearby star 47 Ophiuchi. Compared to the hundred thousand stars or so gravitationally bound in distant NGC 6366, 47 Oph itself is a binary star system  a mere 100 light-years away. Still, the co-orbiting stars of 47 Oph are too close together to be individually distinguished in the image.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_3500.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6366 vs 47 Ophiuchi&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Deimos takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete one orbit around the Red Planet.

About 15 kilometers across at its widest, the smallest of Mars&#x27; two moons is bright though. In fact Deimos is the brightest celestial object in this Martian skyscape captured before sunrise by Perseverance on March 1, the 1,433rd sol of the Mars rover&#x27;s mission.

A line of white oval clouds is visible nearer to the equator.  Impressive results from Juno show that Jupiter&#x27;s weather phenomena can extend deep below its cloud tops, that Jupiter&#x27;s center has a core that is unexpectedly large and soft, and that Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field varies greatly with location.

First, the eight rays that appear to be coming out of the center in the featured infrared image are not real \u2014 they are diffraction spikes caused by the mechanical structure of the Webb space telescope itself. The center of NGC 2566 is bright but not considered unusual, which means that it likely contains a supermassive black hole, although currently not very active. At only 76 million light years away, the light we see from NGC 2566 today left when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The picturesque galaxy is close enough so that Earthly telescopes, including Webb and Hubble, can resolve the turbulent clouds of gas and dust where stars can form and so allows study of stellar evolution. NGC 2566, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy, is notable for its bright central bar and its prominent outer spiral arms.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spiral Galaxy NGC 2566 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nIreneusz Nowak\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Behold one of the most photogenic regions of the night sky, captured impressively.

Hidden from direct view, HH 24&#x27;s central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system&#x27;s rotation axis.

You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet&#x27;s 2024/25 retrograde motion. Of course Mars didn&#x27;t actually reverse the direction of its orbit. Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  In this case Mars&#x27; apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer. After wandering back to the west, under Gemini&#x27;s bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May.

Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring&#x27;s blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.

About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe&#x27;s large-scale structure.

Alpha star of the constellation Ursa Minor, Polaris is also known as the North Star. In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric star trails. The composite image is a digital stack of 400 exposures, each 30 seconds long, taken with camera and tripod fixed to a rotating planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Savudrija Star Trails&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Mike Selby&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-06&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;The bright clusters and nebulae of planet Earth&#x27;s night sky are often given the names of flowers or insects, and its whopping 3 light-year wingspan, NGC 6302 is no exception. With an estimated surface temperature of about 250,000 degrees C, the central star of the planetary nebula is transforming into a white dwarf star, becoming exceptionally hot, and shining brightly in ultraviolet light. The central star is hidden from direct view by a torus of dust, but its energetic ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the nebula. In this sharp, telescopic view composed with narrowband image data, the ionized hydrogen and doubly ionized oxygen atoms are shown in their characteristic red and blue-green hues to reveal a stunning complex of knots and filaments within the nebula&#x27;s wing-like bipolar outflows. NGC 6302 lies about 4,000 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6302: The Butterfly Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC-6302-LRGB-Ha-OIII_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-07&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;On the Mars rover&#x27;s mission Sol 46 or Earth date April 6, 2021, Perseverance held out a robotic arm to take its first selfie on Mars. The WATSON camera at the end of the arm was designed to take close-ups of Martian rocks and surface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and smiling faces. In the end, teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time was required to program a complex series of exposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its surroundings. The resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosaic, one of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken. In this version of the selfie, the rover&#x27;s Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking toward WATSON and the end of the rover&#x27;s outstretched arm. About 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter. Perseverance has now spent over 1,500 sols exploring the surface of the Red Planet. On Earth date January 18, 2024, Ingenuity made its 72nd and final flight through the thin Martian atmosphere.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/PIA24542_fig2.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Perseverance Selfie with Ingenuity&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/PIA24542_fig2_1100c.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;From our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy, we see NGC 3344 face-on. Nearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo Minor. This multi-color Hubble Space Telescope close-up of NGC 3344 includes remarkable details from near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. The frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the spiral&#x27;s central regions. From the core outward, the galaxy&#x27;s colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. Of course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance are in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.

Likely not \u2014 because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 \u2014 named Scylla by its discoverers\u2014glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) \u2014 a nod to the ancient Greek expression \&quot;caught between Scylla and Charybdis\&quot; from Homer\u2019s Odyssey.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-10&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Do oceans under the ice of Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus contain life?  A reason to think so involves  long features -- some dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon&#x27;s icy interior into space. These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon&#x27;s South Pole and create  Saturn&#x27;s mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown in true color from a close flyby.  The deep crevasses are partly shadowed.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus&#x27; surface could contain life.

It&#x27;s likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (\&quot;the scorcher\&quot; in Latin), Vega (\&quot;falling\&quot; in Arabic), and Antares (\&quot;rival to Mars\&quot; in Greek). You are likely even familiar with the name of at least one star too dim to make this list: Polaris.

When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse. Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular \&quot;ring of fire\&quot; eclipse depending on the observer&#x27;s position. Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia. This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the eclipsed Sun&#x27;s magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space. The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.

In sharp focus beyond is UGC 2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant. Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way&#x27;s diameter of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars. That&#x27;s about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way. Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and American astronomer Vera Rubin&#x27;s pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies. Her work was the first to convincingly demonstrate the dominating presence of dark matter in our universe. A new U.S. coin has been issued to honor Vera Rubin, while the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is scheduled to unveil images from its first look at the cosmos on June 23.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/RubinsGalaxy_hst2000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rubin&#x27;s Galaxy&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/RubinsGalaxy_hst1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Mart\u00edn Molin\u00e9&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-14&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;What are all those streaks in the sky? A galaxy, many satellite trails, and a few meteors.  First, far in the distance, the majestic band of our Milky Way Galaxy runs down the left. Mirroring it on the right are several parallel trails of Earth-orbiting Starlink satellites. Many fainter satellite trails also crisscross the image. The two short and bright streaks are meteors \u2014 likely members of the annual Eta Aquariids meteor shower.  The planet Venus shines on the lower right.  Venus and the satellites shine by reflected sunlight.

For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA&#x27;s robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that&#x27;s not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette&#x27;s field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula&#x27;s center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon. This flowery field can be found toward the constellation of the Unicorn  (Monoceros).

It&#x27;s the International Space Station. Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon in 2019. The featured image was taken from Palo Alto, California, USA with an exposure time of only 1/667 of a second. In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.  A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.

Relatively bright in planet Earth&#x27;s sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It&#x27;s hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. The deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Luca Vanzella&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-20&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon in this stack of panoramic composite images. In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again. It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise. Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon. But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises. That&#x27;s because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill. Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Major Lunar Standstill 2024-2025&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD_1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Tunc Tezel&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-21&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth&#x27;s sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma. On the left, Earth&#x27;s figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012. But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet&#x27;s orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds. Take Mars for example. The Red Planet&#x27;s axial tilt is similar to Earth&#x27;s, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth&#x27;s orbit. As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop. The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008. Of course, each world&#x27;s solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves. The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025. Our fair planet&#x27;s 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Two Worlds, Two Analemmas&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars1200.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-22&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How were these unusual Martian spherules created?  Thousands of unusual gray spherules made of iron and rock and dubbed blueberries were found embedded in and surrounding rocks near the landing site of the robot Opportunity rover on Mars in 2004.  To help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a surface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was rich in the Martian orbs.  The Berry Bowl is pictured here, imaged during rover&#x27;s 48th Martian day.  The average size of a Martian blueberry rock is only about 4 millimeters across.  By analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the left of the densest patch of spherules, Opportunity obtained data showing that the underlying rock has a much different composition than the hematite rich blueberries.  This information contributes to the growing consensus that these small, strange, gray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of dirty water.

Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA&#x27;s Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.  Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.  W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

Sort of.  Image data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory, and smaller telescopes on planet Earth are combined in this detailed portrait of face-on spiral galaxy Messier 61 (M61) and its bright center. A mere 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, M61 is also known as NGC 4303.  It&#x27;s considered to be an example of a barred spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way.  Like other spiral galaxies, M61 also features sweeping spiral arms, cosmic dust lanes, pinkish star forming regions, and young blue star clusters.  Its core houses an active supermassive black hole surrounded by a bright nuclear spiral -- infalling star-forming gas that itself looks like a separate spiral galaxy.

A First Look image captured at the new NSF\u2013DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the bright nebulae and star clusters featured include famous stops on telescopic tours of the cosmos: Messier 8 and Messier 20. An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars. Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon&#x27;s turbulent depths. Messier 20&#x27;s popular moniker is the Trifid. Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula&#x27;s glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color. But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The Rubin Observatory visited the Trifid-Lagoon field to acquire all the image data during parts of four nights (May 1-4). At full resolution, Rubin&#x27;s magnificent Sagittarius skyscape is 84,000 pixels wide and 51,500 pixels tall.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SagittariusTrip_Rubin.png&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rubin&#x27;s First Look: A Sagittarius Skyscape&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SagittariusTrip_Rubin1100.png&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Timothy Martin&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-26&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;An interstellar expanse of glowing gas and obscuring dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker, the Seagull Nebula. This broadband portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 3.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, in the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). The bright head of the Seagull Nebula is cataloged as IC 2177, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with embedded massive star HD 53367. The larger emission region, encompassing objects with other catalog designations, is Likely part of an extensive shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions. The notable bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris. Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of interstellar gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula&#x27;s estimated 3,800 light-year distance.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Seagull Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Robert Eder&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Big beautiful barred spiral galaxy Messier 109 is the 109th entry in Charles Messier&#x27;s famous catalog of bright Nebulae and Star Clusters. You can find it just below the Big Dipper&#x27;s bowl in the northern constellation Ursa Major. In fact, bright dipper star Phecda, Gamma Ursa Majoris, produces the glare at the upper right corner of this telescopic frame. M109&#x27;s prominent central bar gives the galaxy the appearance of the Greek letter \&quot;theta\&quot;, \u03b8, a common mathematical symbol representing an angle. M109 spans a very small angle in planet Earth&#x27;s sky though, about 7 arcminutes or 0.12 degrees. But that small angle corresponds to an enormous 120,000 light-year diameter at the galaxy&#x27;s estimated 60 million light-year distance. The brightest member of the now recognized Ursa Major galaxy cluster, M109 (aka NGC 3992) is joined by spiky foreground stars. Three small, fuzzy bluish galaxies also on the scene, identified (top to bottom) as UGC 6969, UGC 6940 and UGC 6923, are possibly satellite galaxies of the larger barred spiral galaxy Messier 109.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 109&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-28&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its familiar nearside to denizens of planet Earth. From lunar orbit, the Moon&#x27;s farside can become familiar, though. In fact this sharp picture, a mosaic from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s wide angle camera, is centered on the lunar farside. Part of a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011, the highest resolution version shows features at a scale of 100 meters per pixel. Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro1600.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lunar Farside&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro800.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-06-29&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Are these trees growing on Mars? No.  Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost. The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars. At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.  When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows. Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer. Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy. The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy&#x27;s bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years. The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia. The Umbrella Galaxy lies about 50 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed northern constellation of Berenice&#x27;s Hair (Coma Berenices).

No. Capturing this stunning alignment took careful planning: being in the right place at the right time. In the featured image taken in June 2024 from Otago, New Zealand, the bright central core of our Milky Way Galaxy, home to the many of our Galaxy&#x27;s 400 billion stars, can be seen between two picturesque rocks spires.  For observers in Earth&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere, the core is only visible throughout the summer. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Milky Way become visible at different angles at different times of the night. As Earth rotates, the orientation of the Milky Way in the sky also shifts -- sometimes standing vertically as seen in the featured image, and other times stretching parallel to the horizon, making it harder to see. In early June, observers can watch it emerge low on the horizon after sunset and gradually arc upward to reveal its full grandeur.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_1874.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Milky Way Through Otago Spires&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/MwSpires_Chay_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nMatipon Tangmatitham \n(NARIT)\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-03&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you know where to look, you can see a thermonuclear explosion from a white dwarf star. Possibly two.  Such explosions are known as novas and the detonations are currently faintly visible with the unaided eye in Earth&#x27;s southern hemisphere -- but are more easily seen with binoculars. Pictured, Nova Lupi 2025 (V462 Lupi) was captured toward the southern constellation of the Wolf (Lupus) last week near the central plane of our Milky Way galaxy.  Nova Lupi 2025 was originally discovered on June 12 and peaked in brightness about a week later. Similarly, Nova Velorum 2025, toward the southern constellation of the Ship Sails (Vela), was discovered on June 25 and peaked a few days later.  A nova somewhere in our Galaxy becomes briefly visible to the unaided eye only every year or two, so it is quite unusual to have two novas visible simultaneously.  Meanwhile, humanity awaits even a different nova: T Coronae Borealis, which should become visible in northern skies and is expected to become even brighter.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/V462Lupi_Pon_1689.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nova V462 Lupi Now Visible&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/V462Lupi_Pon_960_annotated.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Alberto Pisabarro&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-07-04&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Face-on spiral galaxy NGC 6946 and open star cluster NGC 6939 share this cosmic snapshot, composed with over 68 hours of image data captured with a small telescope on planet Earth.

Seen through faint interstellar dust clouds near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the stars of open cluster NGC 6939 are 5,600 light-years in the distance, near bottom right in the frame. Face-on spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is at top left, but lies some 22 million light-years away. In the last 100 years, 10 supernovae have been discovered in NGC 6946, the latest one seen in 2017. By comparison, the average rate of supernovae in our Milky Way is about 1 every 100 years or so.

Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula&#x27;s bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, one investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ou4: The Giant Squid Nebula&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2507/Ou4_difusco1024.jpg&quot;}]

Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water \u2014 but why? If the water\u2019s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.

Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.  The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.  For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.  The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.  Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.  In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy M82.  This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat, as they have been for the past billion years.   The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82&#x27;s gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81&#x27;s spiral arms.  But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  This big battle is seen from Earth through the faint glow of an Integrated Flux Nebula, a little studied complex of diffuse gas and dust clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy. In a few billion years, only one galaxy will remain.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_3780.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Galaxy Wars: M81 versus M82&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M81M82_CAT_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-08&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Cataloged as M1, the Crab Nebula is the first on Charles Messier&#x27;s famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab&#x27;s dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023. This cosmic crustacean lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Crab_Webb_998.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-09&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA\u2019s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.

Barnacle Bill is the rock just left of the house cat-sized, solar-paneled Sojourner. Yogi is the big friendly-looking boulder at top right. The \&quot;couch\&quot; is the angular rock shape visible near center on the horizon. Look at the image with red/blue glasses (or just hold a piece of clear red plastic over your left eye and blue or green over your right) to get the dramatic 3D perspective. The stereo view was recorded by the remarkable Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) camera. The IMP had two optical paths for stereo imaging and ranging and was equipped with an array of color filters for spectral analysis.  Operating as the first astronomical observatory on Mars, the IMP also recorded images of the Sun and Deimos, the smallest of Mars&#x27; two tiny moons.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/mars10_st_path_big.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Yogi and Friends in 3D&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/mars10_st_path_big.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Donald Mitchell&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-11&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;If you could stand on Venus -- what would you see?

The desolate landscape it saw included flat rocks, vast empty terrain, and a featureless sky above Phoebe Regio near Venus&#x27; equator. On the lower left is the spacecraft&#x27;s penetrometer used to make scientific measurements, while the light piece on the right is part of an ejected lens-cap.  Enduring temperatures near 450 degrees Celsius and pressures 75 times that on Earth, the hardened Venera spacecraft lasted only about an hour. Although data from Venera 14 was beamed across the inner Solar System over 40 years ago, digital processing and merging of Venera&#x27;s unusual images continues even today.

The resulting featured illustration shows that just like many other spiral galaxies, our Milky Way has a very thin central disk. Our Sun and all the stars we see at night are in this disk. Although hypothesized before, perhaps more surprising is that the disk appears curved at the outer edges. The colors of our Galaxy&#x27;s warped central band derive mostly from dark dust, bright blue stars, and red emission nebulas.

The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn&#x27;t represent a beginning, though. Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto&#x27;s tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet).

M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse&#x27;s large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. The sharp image shows stunning features of the galaxy&#x27;s face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself. Also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation Ursa Major, about 25 million light-years away.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M101_hst6000.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Messier 101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M101_hst1280.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-17&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;This close-up from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&#x27;s HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern Acidalia Planitia.

But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the sci-fi novel, \&quot;The Martian,\&quot; by Andy Weir. The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site, corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame. For scale, Watney&#x27;s 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater.

In a clear sky from a dark location at the right time, a faint band of light becomes visible across the sky.  Soon after your eyes become dark adapted, you might spot the band for the first time.  It may then become obvious.  Then spectacular.  One reason for your growing astonishment might be the realization that this fuzzy swath, the Milky Way, contains billions of stars.  Visible in the featured image, high above in the night sky, the band of the Milky Way Galaxy arcs.  Also visible are the colorful clouds of Rho Ophiuchi on the right, and the red and circular Zeta Ophiuchi nebula near the top center. Taken in late February from Maunakea, Hawaii, USA, the foreground telescope is the University of Hawaii&#x27;s 2.2-Meter Telescope.

Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth&#x27;s shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS&#x27;s silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.  This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several Sun&#x27;s prominences around the edge.

Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy. This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy&#x27;s halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63&#x27;s star streams in the next few billion years.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod2048.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Curly Spiral Galaxy M63&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/M63_HaLRGB_Apod1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Massimo Di Fusco&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-23&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Most globular star clusters roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, but globular cluster NGC 6366 lies close to the galactic plane. About 12,000 light-years away toward the constellation Ophiuchus, the cluster&#x27;s starlight is dimmed and reddened by the Milky Way&#x27;s interstellar dust when viewed from planet Earth. As a result, the stars of NGC 6366 look almost golden in this telescopic scene, especially when seen next to relatively bright, bluish, and nearby star 47 Ophiuchi. Compared to the hundred thousand stars or so gravitationally bound in distant NGC 6366, 47 Oph itself is a binary star system  a mere 100 light-years away. Still, the co-orbiting stars of 47 Oph are too close together to be individually distinguished in the image.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_3500.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;NGC 6366 vs 47 Ophiuchi&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_1024.jpg&quot;},{&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-24&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Deimos takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete one orbit around the Red Planet.

About 15 kilometers across at its widest, the smallest of Mars&#x27; two moons is bright though. In fact Deimos is the brightest celestial object in this Martian skyscape captured before sunrise by Perseverance on March 1, the 1,433rd sol of the Mars rover&#x27;s mission.

A line of white oval clouds is visible nearer to the equator.  Impressive results from Juno show that Jupiter&#x27;s weather phenomena can extend deep below its cloud tops, that Jupiter&#x27;s center has a core that is unexpectedly large and soft, and that Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field varies greatly with location.

First, the eight rays that appear to be coming out of the center in the featured infrared image are not real \u2014 they are diffraction spikes caused by the mechanical structure of the Webb space telescope itself. The center of NGC 2566 is bright but not considered unusual, which means that it likely contains a supermassive black hole, although currently not very active. At only 76 million light years away, the light we see from NGC 2566 today left when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The picturesque galaxy is close enough so that Earthly telescopes, including Webb and Hubble, can resolve the turbulent clouds of gas and dust where stars can form and so allows study of stellar evolution. NGC 2566, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy, is notable for its bright central bar and its prominent outer spiral arms.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_1280.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Spiral Galaxy NGC 2566 from Webb&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_960.jpg&quot;},{&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\nIreneusz Nowak\n&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-05-27&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;Behold one of the most photogenic regions of the night sky, captured impressively.

Hidden from direct view, HH 24&#x27;s central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system&#x27;s rotation axis.

You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet&#x27;s 2024/25 retrograde motion. Of course Mars didn&#x27;t actually reverse the direction of its orbit. Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  In this case Mars&#x27; apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer. After wandering back to the west, under Gemini&#x27;s bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May.

Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring&#x27;s blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.

About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Airglow.  Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.  A spectacular sky is visible through this banded airglow, with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running up the image center, and M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, visible near the top left.

In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe&#x27;s large-scale structure.

In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric star trails. The composite image is a digital stack of 400 exposures, each 30 seconds long, taken with camera and tripod fixed to a rotating planet.&quot;,&quot;hdurl&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj.jpg&quot;,&quot;media_type&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;service_version&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Savudrija Star Trails&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SavudrijaSTARTRAILS_Nadj1024.jpg&quot;}]
